# The reason we only need to check up to the square root of 
# N is that a number has exactly 3 divisors if and only if it is the square of a prime number.
# A number x has exactly 3 divisors if and only if x is of the form p^2, where p is a prime number.
# The divisors of p^2 are:1, p, and p^2.Hence, exactly 3 divisors.
# For example, if N=100,then under root 100 =10. We only need to check prime numbers up to 10. 
# The squares of these primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are 4, 9, 25, and 49 respectively, all of which are â‰¤100
