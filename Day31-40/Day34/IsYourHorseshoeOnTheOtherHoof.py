# this is code with array implementation i have submitted both and both are working
# arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
# arr1=[]
# for i in range(4):
#     if arr[i] not in arr1:
#         arr1.append(arr[i])
# print(4-len(arr1))

# here i got to know about set it does not let any duplicate value
